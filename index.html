    <p class="lead">My task for this project was to update and redesign the current website homepage to be more accessible, engaging, and easy to navigate. To do this I relied on user research and testing to understand what users wanted from their county website. Using the findings from the research allowed me to redesign the website to meet the needs of the user. I wanted the redesign to capture the spirit of the physical place in its design. Humboldt County is verdant and wild in its natural beauty and I wanted the site to evoke those feelings for the user.</p>

    <div class="media-body">
      <h5 class="mt-0">Lo-Fi Wireframes</h5>
      Using Figma, I began creating low-fidelity wireframes, for both mobile and desktop versions of the site, using the information I gathered from my evaluations, annotations, and user research. At this stage, the wireframes were defined enough for some user testing. Based on the test, I made a few alternations and moved on to creating high-fidelity prototypes.

      <h5 class="mt-0">Hi-Fi Wireframes</h5>
      Once the aesthetics were dialed in, I moved on to design the final screens in Figma. My goal was to create a visual identity that’s aligned with the values and identity of the county, and motto which is: “California's Redwood Coast.” For the overall feel of the site, I wanted to keep it simple, organic, and clear.    </div>
